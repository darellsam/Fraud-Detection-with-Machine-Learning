# Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions. It focuses on analyzing patterns in transaction data and building predictive models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle:

## ✅ Goals
  • Explore and understand features that indicate fraudulent behavior.

  • Apply supervised learning algorithms.

  • Handle imbalanced datasets using techniques like class weighting.

  • Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## 📌 Notes
This is an educational project and is not intended for production or financial decision-making.

Due to the imbalanced nature of fraud datasets, evaluation should prioritize recall over precision over accuracy.
